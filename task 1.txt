Differentiate between document and window objects
The `document` and `window` objects are two fundamental concepts in web development, specifically within the context of the 
Document Object Model (DOM) and browser environment.

1. Window Object:
   - It represents an open window in the browser.
   - Serves as the global object in the browser environment, meaning all global variables and functions are properties 
   of the window object.
   - Includes properties and methods to control the browser window, such as the URL, history, screen dimensions, and 
   methods to open or close windows.
   - It is the top-level object in the DOM hierarchy, and there can only be one window object per browser window.

2. Document Object:
   - Represents the HTML document loaded in that window.
   - It is a direct child of the window object and can be accessed as `window.document`.
   - Provides properties and methods to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of the document.
   - Every element in the webpage, such as paragraphs, headings, and tables, is part of the document object model and 
   can be accessed and manipulated through the document object.

In summary, the window object is about the browser window and global JavaScript environment, while the document 
object pertains to the content and structure of the webpage loaded within that window.
